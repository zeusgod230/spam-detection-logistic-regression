# 📧 Spam Email Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a beginner-friendly machine learning project that classifies emails as **spam** or **not spam** using classical ML techniques.

The project focuses on understanding the **end-to-end ML workflow**—from data loading to model training and evaluation—using clean and reproducible code practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam detection is a binary classification problem.  
In this project, a machine learning model is trained on numerical features extracted from email content to predict whether an email is spam.

A **scikit-learn Pipeline** is used to keep preprocessing and modeling clean, modular, and reproducible.
